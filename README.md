# Librabry_Management_System_
Project Overview:
I created the Library Management System (LMS) as a Python-based application to streamline library operations for small to medium-sized libraries. This project allows efficient management of books, tracking of borrowing and returning processes, and handling of user records. By integrating MySQL for data storage, I ensured robust and reliable data management, showcasing my skills in Python programming and database integration.

Features:
Book Management: Add, view, and manage book records (title, author, ISBN, etc.).
Search Functionality: Search books by title, author, or other attributes.
Borrow and Return Books: Manage book issuance and returns for library members.
User Management: Handle user information for borrowing purposes.
MySQL Integration: Store and retrieve library data using a MySQL database for persistent and efficient data management.
